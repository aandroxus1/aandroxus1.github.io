        <h3 id="txt">Yesterday, I realised that I have had relatively consistent feelings for Seth Smith, previously Paige Smith, for about 2 years. Today, the 6th of January 2022, at 2AM, he cut me off. Permanently. As of right now I am approaching my lowest I have ever been at. The reason I am writing this is really unknown. Just because, I suppose. I need to get my feelings out somehow, and posting them on a private/public website on the internet is definitely a smart way of doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lDgXt7RRfSg">Here</a> is the song that he showed me when we were dating, and has stuck with my core self since. I have not had feelings for someone like I have had for him, and I don't think I really will again. Nobody I have dated was like him, and nobody ever will be. He was amazing to me. I loved him. We first dated on the 21st of March, 2020. I had liked him for a month or so before this, and we started dating just as we went into lockdown. We used to flirt in our Tech lessons, and even with the most annoying person getting in the way, they were still my favourite times. We started dating, and due to lockdown, we had a relatively distanced relationship. I remember when he starting counting down the days to my birthday, and he would not stop. I loved that. His birthday was on the 25th of July, and when it was his I got him a BTS hoodie I had found, it isn't very good but still, I tried. I had also made him a BTS card, hand drawn with the logo precisely measured using computer measurements. I remember converting the size into a ratio so I could fit it onto the card. When we met back up for the first time, god it was so awkward, but somehow so cute. We would barely hold hands but still I felt so close to you. Our hugs were legendary, hehe. You were so nervous. We got closer over the time we were together, and we started to hug more and feel more comfortable being together. Oh, god, the time at Kirsty's. You know exactly what I mean, even I find that memory awkward and gross. But still, the one good thing that happened at Kirsty's. Our first kiss. It was so amazing that I have never forgotten it. I remember every detail. We used to call at nights, too. I loved talking to you, late at night. It made me feel so safe and comfortable.I loved everything about you. Your laugh, your face, and your sneezes, hehe. When we used to go to Ted's, they were some of my closest memories. When you first put on my headset and started playing, when we would cuddle up, when we would just laugh together, when we were sitting on the floor together, me in a really bad headspace, and you kissed me. I haven't had that with anyone since. Nobody genuinely cared about me like you did. We loved eachother, and we were best friends at the same time. I know you agree that's the best kind of love. The main thing I loved about us was that we loved eachother without physicality. No sex, nothing, yet I was the happiest I ever was. That's how much you meant to me. That's how much you mean to me. My feelings have stayed for you without the idea of physicality. Given my track record, that should mean something lol. I honestly have felt things for you that I never have for anyone else. You are, and probably will always, be the most important person I have ever met. Thank you for making my life just that much better. <i><br><br> Scooba-dooba-dap-dap-di-di-die<br>Scooba-dooba-dap-dap-di-di-die<br>I love you<br>Another cliché, baby<br>Scooba-dooba-dap-dap-di-di-die<br>Baby, Imma do whatever you like<br>I love you<br>Another cliché baby </i></h3>
